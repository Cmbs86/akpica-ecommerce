# Contributing to AKPICA.
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. First `Fork` this Repo to your Github account 
2. `Clone` the forked repo to your local machine
3. Create a new `branch` on your local machine
4. Make your changes and `commit` them to your local repo
5. `Push` your changes to your forked repo
6. Submit a `Pull Request` so that we can review your changes
7. Add a description to your `Pull Request` that explains your changes
8. If everything is ok, we will `merge` your `Pull Request` to the `main` branch

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Pilag6/akpica-ecommerce/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Pilag6/akpica-ecommerce/issues); it's that easy!
